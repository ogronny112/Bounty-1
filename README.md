README Addition: Authentication vs. Authorization and Deleting Users


Authentication vs. Authorization: Understanding Their Differences and Implications for User Deletion
Introduction
In any web application, managing user access and actions involves two key concepts: authentication and authorization. These concepts play a crucial role in defining who can perform certain actions, such as deleting a user account. In this document, we will analyze whether allowing user deletion only after authentication is a good idea. We will also clarify the difference between authentication and authorization and discuss why these distinctions are important for application security.

What is Authentication?
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user. When a user logs in, they provide credentials (such as a username and password) to prove they are who they claim to be. Authentication answers the question: "Who are you?"

Purpose: To confirm the identity of a user.
Example: A user logs in with their username and password.
What is Authorization?
Authorization, on the other hand, determines what an authenticated user is allowed to do. It involves setting permissions and access controls to restrict what actions a user can perform based on their identity and roles. Authorization answers the question: "What can you do?"

Purpose: To control access to resources and actions based on user identity and roles.
Example: An admin can delete users, but a regular user cannot.
Analysis of Allowing User Deletion After Authentication
1. Clarity
Allowing user deletion functionality after authentication means that any user who successfully logs in can perform the deletion operation. This approach may seem straightforward, but it has significant implications:

Pros:

Simplicity: It simplifies the user flow by allowing authenticated users to perform deletions.
Direct Access: Once authenticated, the user has direct access to perform various actions, reducing the need for complex permissions checks.
Cons:

Security Risk: If all authenticated users can delete accounts, it opens the door to potential misuse. For instance, a malicious user might delete other users’ accounts.
Lack of Granularity: This approach does not differentiate between different types of users or roles (e.g., admins vs. regular users).
2. Relevance
The concept of restricting user deletion to authenticated users only is relevant but incomplete without considering authorization. Authentication alone does not ensure that a user has the right to perform all actions. For instance, user deletion should be restricted to users with specific roles or permissions.

Authorization Needed: It is essential to implement authorization checks to ensure that only users with the appropriate roles (e.g., admins) can perform sensitive actions like deleting user accounts.
3. Structure
A clear understanding of authentication and authorization can be structured as follows:

Introduction: Define authentication and authorization.
Analysis: Discuss the implications of allowing deletion after authentication and the role of authorization.
Conclusion: Emphasize the importance of combining both concepts to secure user actions.
Depth of Analysis
Allowing user deletion after authentication, without proper authorization checks, can be risky. Here’s a deeper look:

Security Implications: If the system relies solely on authentication, any authenticated user could potentially delete any account. This lack of distinction between user roles can lead to data loss or malicious actions.
Best Practices: Best practices involve both authentication and authorization:
Authentication ensures that the user is who they claim to be.
Authorization ensures that the authenticated user has the right to perform the action (e.g., only admins can delete users).
Combining these practices ensures that user actions are both verified and controlled, enhancing overall system security.

Conclusion
In summary, while allowing user deletion functionality after authentication is a necessary step, it is not sufficient by itself. Effective security requires combining authentication with robust authorization checks to control access to sensitive actions. This dual approach helps prevent misuse and ensures that only users with the appropriate permissions can perform critical operations.
